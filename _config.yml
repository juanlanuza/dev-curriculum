bio: "System Administrator from Murcia. In love with games, music and technology from a very youth age. I graduated in Computer engineering. I like to study about everything to acquire new skills."

#      exchange work and study experience with people around me and share my knowledge with the ones that want it. I work with Web Development since 2009 and with
 #     Mobile Development since 2015 as Freelancer and in some Brazilian companies too.
  #    I'm the creator of CodeShare, a free portal with articles, videos, etc, about Software Development. The purpose of this project is to help people who want
   #   to learn about Software Development and start their careers in IT area and to help people that already work with Software Development to improve their
    #  technical knowledge to get better job opportunities.
#      I like to work with both: Front-End and Back-End development. I work with many languages, frameworks and technologies."
